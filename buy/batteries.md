# Batteries - Best Buy Tips

<img src="/buy/images_batteries/battery_banner.jpg" alt="batteries banner" height="200px" />

## Introduction

<img src="/buy/images_batteries/lir1632.avif" alt="LIR1632" width="150px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right"/>

**AA and AAA** batteries are used for years in toys and sensors to make them portable, and with the **coin cell** batteries, 
devices can be made very small but still battery powered.

The advantage for sensors is that you can place them everywhere without the need to wire them.
Some devices can run for years on a single battery, but now and then you still need to **replace** them.

Before you start using a new sensor, first check what kind of battery it uses and if you already have some of them available in case they are empty.
When it gets out of fuel, you can directly replace it with a new battery.

To avoid waste of pressure metals, you can also use **rechargeable** equivalents.

> **Did you know that for all the regular coin cells, there are also rechargeable variants available**

On the long end, they are cheaper because you can use them over and over again. 
You also don't have to worry about buying new ones, just recharge and reuse them!

If you use the disposables, and they are empty, bring them to a location where they can recycle them!

These are common types of batteries:
* [AA](#aa)
* [AAA](#aaa)
* [CR2032](#cr2032)
* [CR1632](#cr1632)
* [CR2450](#cr2450)

<br>

On this page, you find links to online stores where you can buy the most common batteries also the links to the rechargeable equivalents.
Also, ways to convert a battery powered device into a wall powered device.\
And how you can replace a CR2032 battery for two AAs for a much longer battery life.

The advantage of these is that they are everywhere available to buy, also in your local supermarket.
Because of the size, they can run for a long time on a single battery. Even these are available as rechargeable. 
The downside is that these make the sensor also quite big.

<img src="/buy/images_diy/battery_eliminator.png" height="150px" alt="battery eliminator" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" /></a>

Battery eliminator (aka battery replacements) is, as the name already says, a replacement for battery power device to connect them to the main power.
This saves you from buying new batteries. The big advantage is also that you now can control them with your home automations by adding a smart plugin between the plug and the wall outlet. 
Now you also don't have to worry that you forgot them to put them off again.
There are different variants of them. Replacements for AA or AAA batteries and with a plug or USB connector. 
The advantage of a USB connector is that you can plug multiple to an active powered USB-hub to control multiple ones.
