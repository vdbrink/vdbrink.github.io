## CR2032 coin cell to two AA batteries adapter
*18.5x longer life span*

Due to the small size of the CR2032, they don't contain so much power as AA batteries.\
There is a way to replace a small CR2032 battery with two high capacity AA batteries for a much longer (18.5x) life span for your sensors.

How it works: A single CR2032 is 3V, two AA batteries in series are comparable, 2.4 - 3V (depending on the battery model).
You place two (rechargeable) AA batteries in a case with a female USB port.
Plug in here a CR2032-to-USB-male adapter (aka battery eliminator).

**The amount of ampere is now 4200mAh compared to 225mAh (18.5x more) than the single coin cell was!**\
Yes, you have a big box attached to your sensor now but when you use it for already hidden (temperature/leak/..) sensors this is not a problem.

So, you need these **three items**, plug them together, and you're done:
