Due to the small size of the CR2032, they don't contain so much power as AA batteries.\
There is a way to replace a small CR2032 battery with two high capacity AA batteries for a much longer (18.5x) life span for your sensors.

How it works: A single CR2032 is 3V, two AA batteries in series are comparable, 2.4 - 3V (depending on the battery model).
* Place two (rechargeable) AA batteries in a case with a female USB port.
* Connect the male USB cable from CR2032-to-USB adapter (aka battery eliminator).
* Place the other end, with the fake CR2032 battery, in the sensor. 
  Probably you can't close the cover of the sensor anymore without making a hole in it to guide the wire outside.

<br>

**The amount of ampere is now increased to 4200mAh compared to 225mAh. 
That's 18.5x more than the single coin cell was!**\
Yes, you have a big box attached to your sensor now, 
but when you use it for already hidden (temperature/contact/..) [sensors](/buy/smart_home_best_buy_tips), this is not a problem, right?

<br>

To create this: you need these **three items**, plug them together, and you're done:
* [A dummy CR2032 to USB adapter (AliExpress)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDUCKpH) [(AliExpress)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_on2WVlO) or [(AmazonUS)](https://amzn.to/4hDezp1)

* [(At least) two (Eneloop) AA batteries (AliExpress)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooEc2QU) [(AliExpress)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_op4UGsC) or [(AmazonUS)](https://amzn.to/42ZC6fb)

  </a>

The result:\
Still portable, but now with much longer battery life!\
And not buying new CR2032 batteries, just recharge the AA batteries and the sensor can do their job again for years!
