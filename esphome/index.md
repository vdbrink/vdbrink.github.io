# ESPHome custom sensors and actuators

![ESPHome logo](images/esphome.png)

*ESPHome is a product from Nabu Casa, like Home Assistant is also one of them.*

## Introduction

Not every sensor is available on the market as a complete product.
Sometimes the only way is to create one yourself.\
It's also fun to build your own. 
It's also possible to combine multiple sensors together with one ESP board.

The ESP board is a small mini computer with onboard WiFi. ESPHome makes it easy to program these boards.

You define for each ESP board the connected sensors in a template. In the template, you define your ESP board and which and how the sensors are connected.
The sensor registers itself automatically to Home Assistant (or sends its data to a MQTT server).

## Articles

I wrote multiple articles about creating your own wireless WiFi sensors and actuators based on the ESP chip with ESPHome:

* [Motion and Presence sensor based on the RCWL-0516 sensor](microwave_radar_sensor_rcwl-0516)
* [CO2 sensor based on a SCD40 sensor](co2_scd40)
* [CO2 sensor based on a SenseAir S8 sensor](co2_senseair_s8_sensor)
* [Control an Orcon mechanic ventilation system](orcon_mechanic_ventilation)
