## Rounded temperature sensors

What is the added value of one decimal for a temperature? Especially when you show multiple temperatures close to each other, this is only distracting. To create a clean presentation, you can show the rounded value.

Create a new sensor only with the rounded temperature to an integer value.
Here we create a new sensor calls `sensor.temp1_temperature_rounded`

The value of 24.3 will round to 24 and 24.6 will round to 25.

```yaml
{% raw %}
# Sourcecode by vdbrink.github.io
# configuration.yaml
- platform: template
  sensors:
    temp1_temperature_rounded:
      friendly_name: "woonkamer"
      unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
      value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temp_woonkamer') | round(0) }}"
{% endraw %}
```
