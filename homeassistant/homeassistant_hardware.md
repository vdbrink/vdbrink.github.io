# Which hardware to run Home Assistant on?

*Will it be a N100, Raspberry Pi, HP T630 Thin client, or anything else...*

## Introduction

<a href="index"><img src="images/home_assistant_logo.png" style="float: right;margin-left:15px" alt="Home Assistant logo" height="100px"></a>

Maybe you have one or more vendor-locked hubs with its own smart sensors, and each hub has its own app.
And ALL your data is stored in the big guys cloud.
And there is no way you can let them work nicely together or combine it in one app.

"Home automations with Home Assistant" you heard about it, you read about it, and it all sounds as the holy grail!
You've made the choice to dive into the rabbit hole called "Home Assistant" (aka HA).

Or if you're already running Home Assistant on a Raspberry, but it will now become a bit slower, 
and you want to upgrade to something more powerful but don't want to spend a fortune on it. 
Then you're here at the right place to find out which hardware could be the best for you.

</a>

Then comes the question: On which hardware should I run it?
It can be installed on a whole range of hardware: like a **Mini PC, Home Assistant Green, Home Assistant Yellow,
Raspberry Pi, old laptop/desktop, thin client, etc...**\
I split it up in two sections: new hardware but you can also run it on refurbished PCs could be powerful enough!\
I explain on this page which one of these systems fits the best for your situation and what the differences between the
hardware are.

I don't mention ALL possible options here, just in my opinion, the most popular ones.

After reading this page, if you still have questions about the choice you need to make, don't contact me personally,
but use the [social media channels or forums](#need-help).
There are also a lot of other smart and experienced people who can help you further.

## New hardware

If you always want the best experience with Home Assistant, you better choose for new hardware.
If you want to run it for the upcoming years without any performance issue and want to try new (machine learning) features,
then you better choose for a new powerful device.
Nothing is so frustrating as automations that react slow.

The current most popular hardware to run Home Assistant on is an all-in-one mini PCs.

> Target group: If you want to run Home Assistant (and more) on a brand new and fast device.

### All-in-one mini PCs

> It's a kind of mini desktop PC with laptop components and features.

<img alt="NUC" width="200px" src="images_hardware/nuc.webp" {{style_img_right}}/>
Intel started with the all-in-one NUC mini PCs.
They have a small nice-looking and silent square form factor which you also can place ON your desk.
They contain all required hardware in it and with many external ports (USB, network, display).

After this success, many other manufacturers followed with their own versions of this form factor.
<br>
They have enough power to run Home Assistant, together with a lot of other applications.
Without to worry about latency or any other performance issues for the best experience.

> Target group: More advanced and demanding users

#### Basic

As of 2025, the most popular entry-level hardware for Home Assistant is a mini PC with an N100 processor. 
This option offers more than enough power to run Home Assistant smoothly, along with several add-ons, making it the best value for your money.

The N95 and N97 models deliver similar performance, while the newer N150 features more cores and threads, providing even greater speed. 
If you want higher performance, it may be worth spending a bit more on the N150.

Prices for these models can fluctuate based on supply and demand, so I’ve included links to help you compare current offers.

#### High end

<img alt="Beelink EQi12 Core i7-12650H" height="150px" src="images_hardware/ser9_front.avif" {{style_img_right}}/>
If you want to run also heavy processes, like local machine learning functionality on the server, you better can choose for a high-end
model with more memory, faster CPU, GPU and more cores.

### Home Assistant Green vs Yellow

Nabu Casa, the company behind Home Assistant, provides two official hardware devices to run Home Assistant on: 
the **Home Assistant Green** and the **Home Assistant Yellow**.
The green is the all-in-one entry-level device, while the yellow is the more advanced version with more custom options to build.

### Raspberry Pi

<img alt="Raspberry logo" height="100px" src="images_hardware/raspberry_logo.svg" style="float: right"/>

The Raspberry Pi models where for a long time very popular to run Home Assistant on.
Because of the all-in-one board, with low energy consumption and it was cost-efficient.

Currently, they are nowadays less popular due to new [all-in-one mini PCs](#all-in-one-mini-pcs) like the **N100** which
are in the same price range.
They are more powerful (check the CPU benchmark stats!) and have all required components (like memory and storage) already build in.

See this Facebook poll how popular the mini pcs are.

## Older hardware

> Target group: If you still have some unused hardware available.
> Or buy it inexpensive second hand if you want to find out this is something for you.

Make sure the hardware has at least 8 GB RAM and 64 GB SSD hard disk space to install Home Assistant on and have enough
space for related applications as well.

Computer stores or online sites, like Ebay, they sell refurbished computers, mostly they get them in bulk from companies.
They clean them, upgrade the memory and/or hard disk and sell them.
These computers aren’t the newest but have enough power and with the small upgrade can run for another few years without any problem.
This is an affordable way to buy/upgrade hardware to test HA on.

### Desktop

<img alt="desktop" width="150px" src="images_hardware/desktop.webp" {{style_img_right}} />
If you still have a desktop PC lying around, you can use it to run Home Assistant on.

The advantage is that you can easily upgrade hardware elements like memory, processor or extra video card power if
needed.

The disadvantage is they use more power than a laptop or mini PC.

### Laptop

<img alt="laptop" width="150px" src="images_hardware/laptop.jpg" {{style_img_right}} />
A spare laptop can also be used as a server to run Home Assistant on.

The advantage is it's energy-effective and compact.

The disadvantage can be the battery constant on the power or charge daily.
Some laptops also run without a battery, which is the best solution.

### Thin client

<img alt="HP 620" width="130px" src="images_hardware/hp_620.webp" {{style_img_right}} />
A Thin client is compact, energy effective, silent and not expensive.

HP has the T630 or T620 which are often mentioned as good hardware.\
Dell has also Thin clients: the Wyse 5060 or 7020.

They used in offices and now widely available on second hand sites like Ebay.
Even with HA already installed on it.

### NAS

<img alt="QNAP NAS" width="130px" src="images_hardware/nas.png" {{style_img_right}} />
A NAS, is a Network-Attached Storage mostly used as shared network storage,
but there are models that have enough power to also install your own Docker applications, like Home Assistant, on.

A Synology or QNAP NAS are examples of that.
