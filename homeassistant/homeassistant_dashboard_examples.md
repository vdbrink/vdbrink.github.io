## Create a new custom sensor: chair occupancy

By default, the contact status is inverted as preferred.
With this addition to configuration.yaml you can create a new sensor that shows the correct status in your dashboard.
```yaml
{% raw %}
# Sourcecode by vdbrink.github.io
# configuration.yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      chair:
        friendly_name: "chair"
        value_template: >-
          {% if is_state('binary_sensor.contact1_contact', 'off') %}
             on
          {% else %}
             off
          {% endif %}

homeassistant:
  customize: 
    binary_sensor.chair:
      icon: mdi:chair-rolling
{% endraw %}
```
