# Home Assistant dashboard custom element: Auto-entities


<a href="index"><img src="images/home_assistant_logo.png" style="float: right;" alt="Home Assistant logo" height="100px"></a>

Here you find Home Assistant (lovelace) dashboard examples from the custom HACS card element **auto-entities** which you can add to your own dashboards.

Auto-entities is a very powerful addon card that can let you make dynamic entity lists based on (multiple) filters, include and exclude entities, different types of sorting and presenting.

The git repository with also all options and some examples can be found at https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities

Install this integration via this button in your own HA instance
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add-on store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=thomasloven&repository=lovelace-auto-entities&category=integration)

## Temperatures (rounded, sorted and colored)

Show all temperature sensors in order of their temperature from high to low. And show the rounded temperature to a real number and for temperature higher than ideal give them an orange or red color. Blue icons when the temperature is below 10 degrees.

higher 60% orange, higher than 55% white.

## Conditional mushroom cards

Mushroom cards can also be shown conditionally, see my [conditional mushroom card](/homeassistant/homeassistant_dashboard_card_mushroom#nice-weather-only-an-icon) examples.

---
## Chores
I created a [separated page](homeassistant_dashboard_chores.md) about this subject where I use multiple auto entities lists to show which chores must be done and which are already done.
