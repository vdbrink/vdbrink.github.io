# Bin day - LED strip reminder

## Introduction

<img style="float: right;margin-left:20px" src="../homeassistant/images_afvalbeheer/kliko.jpg" height="150px" alt="Kliko">

I was looking for a way to reminder me about the waste collection schedule.
We have four trash bins and every bin has different recurring schedules. With bank holidays it also changes to another day. 
A single notification was not enough, it can easily be swiped away. So I was looking for another nice subtle automation.

I came up with a RBG LED strip under my French antique dresser which indicates which trash bin must be put outside.

## Hardware requirements

I already have a running home server with a Zigbee network, that's why I choose for a Zigbee LED strip. This will also
work for a WiFi/bluetooth/other network type, but then the control will also be different.

Affiliate links are used here. Same price, and you sponsor this blog.

[Zigbee RGB 5m LED strip](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ookcWte) it's available in different versions:
  * Indoor no waterproof (IP20) / Outdoor waterproof (IP65)
  * 5 / 10 meter
  * RGB White or RGB Warm White

It's also possible to use an E27 bulb lamp to create the same light effects.\

## Software requirements

* Home Assistant
  * HACS [Afvalbeheer](../homeassistant/homeassistant_hacs_afvalbeheer) integration or other bin day schedule which applies for your city.
  * Add the [custom days countdown helper entities](../homeassistant/homeassistant_hacs_afvalbeheer#custom-helper-entities-days-count-down)
  * LED strip entity (How to add and integrate this Zigbee LED strip into Home Assistant is not part of this page)
* Node-RED (for the automations)
  * Add and setup the Home Assistant integration in Node-RED [node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket](../node-red/node-red_home-assistant#initial-setup)
  * Load the [Node-RED script](#node-red-script) from this page.
    * Choose to use the HA entity (or Zigbee2MQTT) node, enable the correct one.
    * [Optional] Add to the flow to send a notification (to a phone and/or speaker).
    * [Optional] Add a condition to the flow to turn the light off.

## Installation

### Waste collection schedule

I live in The Netherlands and we have a HACS integration called `Afvalbeheer`.\
This integration downloads the waste collection schedule from most of the collection companies, in the Netherlands, and
generates entities in Home Assistant with the next pick-up date for each type of bin.

I created a [separated blog post page](../homeassistant/homeassistant_hacs_afvalbeheer) about this integration and how I
implemented it. 
Also with extra missing functionality for me, I have the number of days and sorted by the pickup date with the help of custom countdown helper entities.

---

### Node-RED flow to turn the LED strip on, on bin day

I use for all my automations Node-RED. 
Here used with the [Home Assistant integration](../node-red/node-red_home-assistant) to read and control the Home Assistant LED-strip entity.

> **_NOTE:_** If you share the Home Assistant equivalent code with me, I can add it also here.

This is my Node-RED flow which you can use and modify as an example.\
I normally control my Zigbee devices via Zigbee2MQTT, but disabled this node in this example and use the HA nodes. 
I also added the same Home Assistant light entity `ledstrip_bin_day` here. 
Choose which way of integration you want to use, and set the correct entity name, both methods will work with this example.

**Custom helper entities for days countdown**

I created [customer helper entities](../homeassistant/homeassistant_hacs_afvalbeheer#custom-helper-entities-days-countdown) in Home Assistant to show on my dashboard the amount of days for the bin day.
These entities are also used here to check if tomorrow is bin day.

**Test the light**

In addition, I added an inject-node where you can click on to test if the lights goes on.

**Send notification**

Another addition is the node to send the text also to your phone. Check [here](../node-red/node-red_home-assistant_notifications) how to send this message to you Home Assistant companion app.

**Turn LED strip off**

At the bottom, there is an inject-node which get triggered at 0:00 to disable the light again.
There is also a link-node with the value `ledstrip_bin_day trigger off`. You can trigger this when you have another trigger to turn off the light. In my case: \
WHEN the light is on AND the garden gate is opened THEN this LED strip light goes off again. (This is not in this Node-RED example added.)\
Everybody has his own off-condition, you can also turn if off with a light toggle on your dashboard.
For example, in my case when the garden gate is opened, after a specific time, in the evening to put the bin outside the lights turn off again. In case I skip one time I set it off via my dashboard.

#### RGB LED strip colors

I have four bin types, and each bin has his own color.\
I tried to use the same color to light up.

These are my bin types and the RGB and HEX color codes I used in this flow. See the animation how this looks like.

| Bin type  | Bin color | RGB color     | HEX color code |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Garden    | green     | 0,   128,  24 | #008018        |
| Household | gray      | 149, 149, 149 | #959595        |   
| Paper     | blue      | 0,     0, 249 | #0000F9        |
| Plastic   | orange    | 255, 165,  44 | #FFA52C        |

### FAQ

Q: What if two bin has to put outside on the same day?\
A: For me this was never the case yet. In the current situation one color overrules the other one. 
If you implemented also a notification to your phone you get both messages. 
Or if you present the [days countdown](../homeassistant/homeassistant_hacs_afvalbeheer) on your dashboard you know already you have to put multiple outside.
