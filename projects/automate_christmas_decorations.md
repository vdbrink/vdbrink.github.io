During the Christmas season, I have a lot of extra lights and other powered decorations in and around our house. 
**Christmas trees**, **battery powered decorations** and **outside lights** to cheer up the dark days.

It's a lot of work to control them manually every day.\
It's also a waste of energy when no one sees it or it a clear day.\
I've made my life easier by automating them all!

Now I also can control all my Christmas decorations from my phone in a Home Assistant dashboard.

## Advantages

<a href="images_christmas_decorations/ani_snow_globe.gif">
<img src="images_christmas_decorations/ani_snow_globe.gif" alt="snow globe" width="100px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" />
</a>

There are a lot of advantages to automate all the lights and electric decorations. 
It's not only about turning them on and off.
It's more than you can think of, like:
* Don't start every day turning on all the (battery powered) decorations one-by-one manually and at the end of the day turning them off again; [Node-RED automation](#activate-a-light-on-motion-detection)
    * _No use of batteries, no useless power usage, more time for other things, more comfort_
    * _Only downside: No morning gymnastics to switch all the buttons in each corner_
* Come downstairs, and all the cozy lights are (just) on; [Node-RED automation](#activate-a-light-on-motion-detection)
    * _More joy, quicker to the coffee!_
* Outside lights only on when it becomes dark; [Node-RED automation](#activate-a-socket-based-on-outside-lux)
    * _On a sunny day it doesn't make sense to put also all outside lights on_
* Activate something (like playing Christmas music, or a dancing Santa) when someone shows up at your doorstep; [Node-RED automation](#activate-a-socket-based-on-someone-entering-the-house)
    * _A smile on their face_     
* No lights on when there is nobody around for a while; [Node-RED automation](#disable-a-socket-after-a-period-of-inactivity)
    * _No useless power usage, which saves money_
* No power cables to paper Christmas stars;
  * _Freedom to place paper Christmas stars everywhere_
* Spend more time in bed and sleep like a baby; <a href="images_christmas_decorations/outside_tree_light.jpg"><img src="images_christmas_decorations/outside_tree_light.jpg" alt="outside tree lights" width="100px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" /></a>
    * _More rest, more energy, less coffee_
* Fellow house members have no one to blame when the cozy lights are off because you were in a hurry to go to work;
    * _More harmonie, for a better Christmas spirit_
* Less energy consumption, no batteries that need to be replaced which saves money. You still need to buy once the hardware to automate it, but in the end it earns itself back very fast;
    * _Save money to spend on Christmas presents or extra [home automation hardware](/buy/smart_home_best_buy_tips)_
<br>
  
These advantages must be enough excuses to automate these decorations. I even convinced myself again!

## My old situation

<a href="images_christmas_decorations/tree_light_plug_button.jpg">
<img src="images_christmas_decorations/tree_light_plug_button.jpg" alt="Christmas light plug" width="100px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" />
</a>

Before I automated it, there were a lot of manual actions I had to deal with.

I, as a home automation geek, I was (previous year) looking for solutions and found them for all my decorations and lights!
Read along how I did that.

<details>
  <summary><b>> Click here to read the situation before I automated it >></b></summary>

For example, my biggest **Christmas tree** lights have two light strings, and each has a power socket with a button which controls seven different flash modes. 
Each time you press the button, it switches from mode. 
And the normal required non-disco mode is the last mode! So I had to press every day that button seven times. 
And that for two strings of light. For only one tree.
Those sockets are also out of sight under the tree, so you need to dive under the tree to reach them.
And when you press one time too much, you can start all over again! Aargh!

<a href="images_christmas_decorations/dummy_battery_example.jpg">
<img src="images_christmas_decorations/dummy_battery_example.jpg" alt="Christmas light on battery" width="100px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" />
</a>

We also have a lot of **battery powered** decorations.
I could use rechargeable batteries, but then I still have to turn all the decorations on and off manually every day to enjoy it.
As a result, during the season they are only a few times on. And if you forgot one, it ends up with empty batteries after Santa was singing and dancing all night long.

Some of mine **Christmas paper stars** have a normal bulb and powered via the main power. 
This limits the places where to place them, they need to be closed to a wall socket and preferably hide the cable behind some curtains or closet to make it look nice. 
Other stars are battery powered but the button to turn them on is inside the star itself. Not easy to reach when it hangs on the ceiling!

The **plug powered lights** are easy to automate. 
Plug them into a good old-fashioned timers, everybody had already automated it in the previous century like in Home Alone! Every day on exact the same time.

<img src="images_christmas_decorations/home_alone_automatic_timers.gif" alt="Home Alone automatic timers" width="450px" />

Two decades later, we can use "smarter" solutions. 
Like control them more dynamically based on the daylight level or motion and occupancy detection.

## My smart hardware solutions

As mentioned, I have multiple types of Christmas decorations.\
Which results at the end in five different type of power types to automate:

<a href="images_christmas_decorations/random_plugs.jpg">
<img src="images_christmas_decorations/random_plugs.jpg" alt="random plugs" width="120px" style="margin-left:15px;float:right" />
</a>

* [Battery powered decorations](#battery-powered-decorations), 15+ pieces, now controlled with dummy batteries which are connected now to the main power.
* [Infrared controlled LEDs / candles / tea lights](#infrared-wireless-lights) now automatic controlled now by a programmable infrared remote.
* [Christmas tree lights](#christmas-tree-lights) now with a replaced adapter, without a switch button which requires a manual to activate it first.
* [Decoration/lights powered with a power plug](#decorationlights-powered-with-a-power-plug), 10+ pieces, now controlled with a smart socket between it.
* [Outdoor lights](#outdoor-lights) now controlled with outdoor smart sockets.
<br>

In the next chapters I'll describe how I automated each type.

### Battery powered decorations

There are multiple smart hardware device combinations possible to change battery powered decorations. 
Here are some examples.

#### Example 1: battery-to-USB + smart USB adapter + 5V-adapter

An example of a battery powered light is a garland with lights above the door. 
Automated with a battery-to-usb set (a.k.a. battery eliminator/replacement), a smart usb adapter and a 5V-adapter. With the smart USB-adapter you can activate each port individually.

</a>

#### Example 2: battery-to-plug + smart socket

Another example is a battery powered light in a bottle. I use for this a battery-to-plug set and a smart socket.

</a>

#### Example 3: battery-to-USB + USB hub + smart socket

If you have multiple battery power devices close to each other, and you want to automate them the same way, you can use an active powered USB-hub.
This hub can be powered with a smart socket to control all the connected devices at once.

#### Hardware suggestions

As you could read, there are multiple combinations possible to control battery powered devices.
It depends on how many devices you want to control at once and how close they are to each other, which is the best combination in your case.

### Infrared lights

I have Christmas paper stars that contain a regular light bulb.
This reduces the positions where I could place them, 
they must be in reach of a power socket and somewhere where I could keep the power cable out of sight, guide them behind a curtain or so.


  <img src="images_christmas_decorations/paper_star.webp" alt="paper stars" width="300px"/>

I solved this by using battery powered LED lights, which are controllable via an infrared remote. 
I used a Zigbee programmable infrared receiver and transmitter which can learn from the original remote.
This transmitter is a Zigbee, battery powered, device that can be placed in the sight of multiple stars. 
I have it at a distance of five meters and still works great as long as your star is made of thin carton/paper.

#### The programmable infrared remote

I used the [Moes UFO-R11](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/UFO-R11.html){{imgZ2M}}, a battery powered (wireless) Zigbee programmable infared receiver and transmitter to replace the original LED light remote.\
This device can store multiple different signals.

Learn mode:

To learn a new signal, set the device in learning mode by sending this payload to the MQTT topic of the device, for it that `zigbee2mqtt/irremote/set`
```yaml
{% raw %}
{     
  "learn_ir_code":"ON" 
}
{% endraw %}
```
Now a light turned on in front of the device. 
Now you can hold the original remote in front of the device and press a single button. 

The response contains the infrared code to use to resend the signal via this device now.
```yaml
{% raw %}
{
  "battery" : 11,
  "last_seen" : "2024-11-03T09:21:03.343Z",
  "learn_ir_code" : null,
  "learned_ir_code" : "Bb8jphFIAuAXAQF9BuAVA0ABwCPgAwFAE0ABwAdAAUALwANAAUALCcqdvyPBCEgC///gAgcCCEgC",
  "linkquality" : 43,
  "voltage" : 1200
}
{% endraw %}
```

To resend the signal, send on the topic MQTT topic `zigbee2mqtt/irremote/set` this payload to send the same signal as from the original remote.

```yaml
{% raw %}
{
  "ir_code_to_send": "Bb8jphFIAuAXAQF9BuAVA0ABwCPgAwFAE0ABwAdAAUALwANAAUALCcqdvyPBCEgC///gAgcCCEgC"
}
{% endraw %}
```

Now the lights also turned on!

Now you can add these commands to your automation.

### Christmas tree lights

My Christmas tree has a specific EU outlet plug with the output of 31V and 3.6W. But when I was looking at AliExpress, I found this exact same plug but without a power button and without switching the disco modes, just always on.

<a href="https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_mstDarg" target="_blank">
  <img src="images_christmas_decorations/tree_light_plug_no_button.avif" alt="christmas light adapter" height="200px" class="buy-link"/>

<a href="images_christmas_decorations/christmas_tree.jpg">
  <img src="images_christmas_decorations/christmas_tree.jpg" alt="Christmas tree" height="200px" />
</a>

If you also have a plug with a button, you can always try to find a similar plug without a button.\
Please, let me know if you use another one which fits for your light string.

Or if your familiar with soldering and electronics, you can modify the current button and make it always on, but only advised for professionals!!

### Outdoor lights

I have in my garden several waterproof power sockets. Here I use outdoor water-resistant Zigbee power sockets to automate the outdoor decorations and lights.\
In the front yard I put the light string wire through the mailbox to plug it inside.

## Automations

I use Node-RED myself to control all the decoration and light automations.\
If you have such automations in Home Assistant I can add those here also if you share them.

### Activate a light on motion detection

```yaml

{% endraw %}
```

#### Disable a socket after a period of inactivity
