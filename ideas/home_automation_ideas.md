# Home Automation Ideas
*to make your home smart*

<img src="images/idea.png" style="float: right;" alt="Idea" height="200px">

Below is a list of automation ideas, based on devices and locations in and around the house. <br><br>
For already a few years, I follow various forums, newsgroups and videos to gather new ideas, which I then incorporate into my own automations.

This is a constant growing list. I'll update the list with new ideas now and then.

I hope I can inspire you with some new home automation ideas you can integrate in your home.

## Introduction
I've started with a few automations for lights in the living room, the mailbox, and the washing machine.
And I've continually expanded by adding more and more sensors and actuators, which result in 100+ automation flows running in my home.

Criteria for my own automations are:
* Capable of running locally (no-cloud); <img src="images/nocloud.png" style="float: right;" alt="no cloud" height="80px">
* It can also be controlled in the traditional way with "old-fashioned" buttons, so that everyone in the house can operate everything, without an app and even if the smart server is down;
* Works regardless of who is present (no extra trackers or apps needed).

## Devices and locations to be automated

### Mailbox
* Notification when mail is delivered. ([contact sensor](../buy/smart_home_best_buy_tips#contact-sensor) with a separate magnet on the flap)
* Notification if mail is sticking out. (if the [contact sensor](../buy/smart_home_best_buy_tips#contact-sensor) is broken and not closed again after 1 minute)
* Send a picture of the mailbox after something is delivered. (Raspberry Pi Zero W with camera)
