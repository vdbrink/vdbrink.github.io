Everybody has different knowledge levels, budget, and functionality wishes. There is no single best solution for everyone. Compare it to buying a car, there is no single car that fits everybody's needs.

## What is a smart home server?

I read all kinds of different namings for a server which runs your smart home software.\
The names I see mostly are: smart home server, homelab.\
How do you call it? I call it here a "smart home server".

I see it as a full (small) computer with:
* A harddisk, memory, and a processor
* A full operating system
* A local protocol to communicate with your smart home devices

## What is the difference with a smart hub?

A smart home hub usually is a hardware device from a specific brand and only supports that brand (or just a few other ones).
You have a corresponding app which can connect to the hub and control your devices. This works also from remote so, via the internet, that means your hub is also connected to the internet via the cloud. It integrates with the cloud Google Echo, Amazon Echo voice assistants.

Examples of smart home hubs are:
* Tuya
* Philips Hue
* Samsung SmartThings
* Xiaomi Mi Home
* Ikea Tradfri
* (LG) Homey
