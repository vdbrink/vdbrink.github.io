## Connectivity with the app

Jura coffee machines can be connected to your smartphone via WiFi or Bluetooth.
To activate this, you need to plug a Bluetooth or WiFi module into the machine and use the app to find the machine.

## Connectivity issues?

If your phone has problems to find and keep connection to the coffee machine, this can be caused by your Wifi router settings.
If you've set your network SSID to hidden, the Jura app will not easily be able to find your coffee machine.

The machine only uses the 2.4 GHz band to connect to your router over Wifi. 
If you only use 5 GHz it won't work.

The app requires that your Wifi network is connected with the internet to work properly.

## My Feature requests

* The option to disable the check if Bluetooth is enabled. 
If you own a machine (like the Z10) which uses only a Wifi connection, you don't need an enabled Bluetooth connection! Now I get an annoying error message that Bluetooth is not enabled, while I don't need it at all!

* No need for an internet connection to use the app.
If your Wifi is (temporarily) not connected to the internet, you cannot use the app to create your coffee.

* Wait a bit longer to show the connectivity to the coffee machine.
Now the status is constant flickering between "Connecting" and "Connected", which is annoying.

* Fix error message translations.
