After I bought a Jura Z10 espresso machine, I had a lot of questions while using it. 
Questions about cleaning, maintenance, possibilities, accessory, hacks, app, etc!
I watched many instruction videos and joined social media groups to learn more and get the most out of my machine.

I decided to bundle my gathered information and experiences on this site, so you can benefit from it as well.

If you have tips or other suggestions for this page, please let me know.
