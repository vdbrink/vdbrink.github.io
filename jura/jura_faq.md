> **_NOTE:_** The FAQ answers are from my personal experience or what I found and multiple people suggest as best practice.

**Q: After three weeks I get the message I need to replace the water filter, is this normal?**\
A: Yes, depending on the [water filters](jura_products#water-filters) and the defined water hardness.

**Q: Can I disable the water filter functionality?**\
A: Yes, but this is only adviced if you already use filtered water (by your refrigerator).
You can disable the water filter in the settings menu.

**Q: Can I clean the brewing unit easily myself?**\
A: No, the brewing unit is not removable on the Jura Z10.
It is cleaned automatically during the cleaning program.

**Q: Do I need to bring it to service once in a while?**\
A: If you maintain it well, and follow all the instructions the machine gives you, you don't need to bring it to service. Checkout the [cleaning and maintenance page](jura_z10_cleaning_maintenance) for more information.

**Q: Can I set the temperature higher?**\
A: A lot of people ask this question, but the Jura Z10 has a fixed temperature setting which produce not very hot coffee is a common used complain.
There is a [cleaning tip](jura_z10_cleaning_maintenance#hotter_coffee) which may help to increase the temperature a bit, but it is not guaranteed to work.
