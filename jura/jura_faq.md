## Introduction

When you buy and use a Jura coffee machine, you have a lot of questions.

I have a separated page about [maintenance](jura_cleaning_maintenance) look here if your answer is maybe here.

If your question is not answered here, 
please use Jura social media groups like [Facebook - JURA COFFEE MACHINE OWNERS GROUP](https://www.facebook.com/groups/526724898563529) 
[Facebook - Jura Coffee Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/224296378455533)
or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jura/) to ask your question. 
Here are a lot of people who can maybe help you with your question.

> **_NOTE:_** The FAQ answers are from my personal experience or what I found and multiple people suggest as best practice.

**Q: After three weeks I get the message I need to replace the water filter, is this normal?**\
A: Yes, depending on the [water filters](jura_products#water-filters) and the defined water hardness.

**Q: Can I disable the water filter functionality?**\
A: Yes, but this is only advised if you already use filtered water (by your refrigerator).
You can disable the water filter in the settings menu.

**Q: Can I clean the brewing unit easily myself?**\
A: No, the brewing unit is not removable on the Jura Z10.
It is cleaned automatically during the cleaning program.

**Q: Do I need to bring it to service once in a while?**\
A: If you maintain it well, and follow all the instructions the machine gives you, you don't need to bring it to service. Checkout the [cleaning and maintenance page](jura_cleaning_maintenance) for more information.

**Q: Can I set the temperature higher?**\
A: You can change the temperature of the milk.
Another way to keep the coffee warm is to preheat the cup by using a [cup warmer](/jura/jura_products#cup-warmer) or put for a few minutes hot water in the cup. 
Then the cup doesn't cool down the coffee via the cold cup itself.
