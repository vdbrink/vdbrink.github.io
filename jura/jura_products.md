Also, other suppliers have good products which can be used.

## Beans

There are many brands with all kinds of flavors for coffee beans. 
All with its own strength and additional tastes.

The most important thing to pay attention is to choose for beans which are not oily. 
The oil can clog grinders and pipes, leading to reduced performance and costly repairs.

One of my favorite tastes is this medium strength [Lavazza, Rossa Beans](https://amzn.to/46nuIMk):

## Cup warmer

Is your coffee always too fast cold?
With a preheated cup, the coffee will be much warmer than when you use a cold cup.
It holds the cups at a constant temperature of 55 degrees (131 Fahrenheit).

Jura provides a cup warmer with two draws. 
It can contain up to: 6 cappuccino cups (Ø 90 mm), 6 standard espresso cups (Ø 57 mm), 4 coffee cups (Ø 66 mm).
