# Jura Cleaning and Maintenance

## Introduction

<img style="float:right;height:150px; margin-left:15px;" src="images/jura_z10.jpg" alt="Jura Z10 machine">

After I bought the Jura coffee machine, I want to keep it in good condition to enjoy from it for many years to come. 
This page gives you some tips and tricks based on how I clean and maintain my Jura coffee machine.

## Machine outside

You shouldn't put this drip rack in the dishwasher, as it can damage the coating.
Instead, using a damp microfiber cloth, you can wash easily the outside of the machine and remove water drips, dust and the coffee stain part without scratching it.

## Waste water collection

The waste water collection container is located at the bottom of the machine.
You can remove it by pulling the tray out.

I suggest to clean all the waste water collection parts and the coffee grounds collection tray once a week thorough to avoid mold and bacteria growth.
Most parts can be cleaned in the dishwasher, or even better, by hand with warm water and a mild detergent.

## Milk system

The milk system cleaner should be used minimal on a daily basis.
Milk system cleaners are designed to break down and remove milk proteins, fats, and calcium buildup that can accumulate in coffee machine milk systems.
These cleaners are essential for maintaining the hygiene and performance of the frothers.
The Jura Z10 has a milk system cleaning program that you can choose manually to clean the milk system.

## Internal brewing unit

The brewing unit isn't a removable part from the Jura machines.
You can clean it by running the cleaning program, which will clean the brewing unit with a cleaning tablet.
The machine indicates when you need to run this program.

You can also trigger the cleaning program manually by <TODO>

Check out this video how to run the brewing unit cleaning program with cleaning tablets.

## Water container

The water container should be cleaned regularly from the outside but also from the inside to avoid limescale buildup and bacteria growth.
You can clean it with warm water and a mild detergent. 
Dry it from the inside also to remove all possible water stains.

## Descaling

The Jura Z10 has a built-in descaling program that you can run when the machine indicates it.

You can use tabs, powder or liquid descaling agents to descale the machine.

Check out this video how to run the descaling cleaning program.

[![Descaling program](http://img.youtube.com/vi/cf8u-9VGFxE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf8u-9VGFxE "Descaling program")

There are all kinds of descaling products available which can be used for kettles, but those can also be used for your coffee machine.

### Hotter coffee

Someone suggested to clean the flap next to the waste water collector.

Please let me know if this works for you or if you have any other suggestion to increase the temperature.
