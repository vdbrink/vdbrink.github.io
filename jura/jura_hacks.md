## Automatic water tank refill

The Jura machines use a lot of water and the water tank needs to be refilled often manually.
By connecting the water tank to the water supply drain and use a float to see when it needs to be filled again.

## Milk pipe holder

Normally, the milk pipe dangles and can leak some leftover milk.
With this 3D printed holder, you can plug the pipe end in a holder on top of the machine.
Which prevents the milk pipe from dangling and leaking.
